Creating the Add-On Product
---------------------------
Run `make dist` to create y2update.tgz

An add-on product contains (also)
    * RPMs (in /suse/ directory)
    * /y2update.tgz (which contains the inst-sys update)
    * installation.xml (that defines the add-on workflow)
    * content file describes the product

Installation - Second Stage
---------------------------
Add-on must require the 'yep-base' patern that will contain (at least)
yast2-yep RPM package. This pattern/package(s) must be installed before
running the add-on workflow in a second stage.

Installation - Running System
-----------------------------
On a running system (/sbin/yast2 add-on), installation workflow will call
sw_single first with pre-selecetd 'yep-base' (required by the product), after
the packages get installed, YEP configuration will be called.

The other option is to have a y2update.tgz file that would contain the
YaST configurator and a special YaST script that would make sure that
all the needed packages get installed before running the configuration
scripts.
