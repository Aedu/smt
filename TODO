TODO (SMT11):
=============================

- use new installation.xml and test it according to bnc #377154

- yast2-smt: check if /etc/zypp/credentials.d/NCCcredentials file
             exists. If not, display and error message and advise 
             the user to register the system first. 

             From Stano:
             Well, it can then assume that the system is not registered, suggest 
             registraation. But for all offline scenarios, it has to be able to 
             create the file itself.

- yast2-smt: check the permissions of /etc/zypp/credentials.d/NCCcredentials
             the user "smt" needs read access to this file.
             Not sure if we want to do a chown smt.root ... or set
             a ACL to allow smt to read this file.
             Maybe first try to set a ACL, if this does not work, change the
             owner.


Nice-To-Have but not so important
=================================

- verify checksum of /repodata/repomd.xml

- Do we need to provide a keyring and accept new keys? 
  Talk to security-team about this.

  Talked to security-team: This is nice to have but no requirement
  because the client are checking the repomd too.

- provide --config <configfile> options for the smt commands to
  use a different configfile then /etc/smt.conf 



DONE:
=====

- In the parser we print errors if we found invalid XML syntax but ignore them. 
  We should return errors and count them in SLE11.

- better mirror report. Shorter with more informations. 

- move the re-try on error loops into Job::mirror() function. Then we have the
  code one time and not X times in the code.

- idea to speed-up mirroring by integrating the hardlink feature.
  * create a table in DB with key = <rpm-name>-<checksum> and path
    column
  * during mirror, when fetching a new rpm, first look into DB if we
    have it already. If yes, create a hardlink (or copy) instead of
    downloading it from the network.
    If we do not have it yet, download it and create a database entry

- idea to speep-up mirroring by "diffing" repodata/
  * parse repodata/ and .repodata/ and find out which files are changed or 
    new. After having this list, download only these files.
    [implemented in a different way]

- Add Yum.pm, which mirror the headers/ dir and then call RpmMd.pm
  This is more straight forward then doing everything in RpmMd.pm
