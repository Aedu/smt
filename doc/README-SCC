Installation of SCC-enabled SMT
===============================

Install and register SLES11-SP3. Afterwards, add the beta repository e.g. via zypper:

  zypper ar <url> SMT-BETA

You can verify that the repository is added correctly and can be refreshed via 

  zypper ref

Then you can follow either via standard installation of SMT (YaST add-on module, you will need the standard SNT media) or install the packages manually via zypper. Remember that to satisfy all dependencies, the standard SMT media is necessary, the BETA repository is not sufficient.. If needed, add it also via zypper for manual installation. If you install SMT via zypper, run the YaST smt-server module to perform initial configuration, which includes selecting the registration server (SCC or NCC).


Upgrade to SCC-enabled SMT
==========================

To upgrade existing SMT, add the BETA repository via zypper

  zypper ar <url> SMT-BETA

and then upgrade packages, which are available via this repository

  zypper dup --from SMT-BETA

or use other tools to bring the packages 'smt' and 'yast2-smt' to the version available via the BETA repository. You can use

  zypper search --version smt

in order to check that the right versions are installed. Once SMT is upgraded, you can migrate it from NCC to SCC as described below.



Migration between SCC and NCC
=============================

SMT can talk to only one registration service (SCC, NCC, alternatively also SLMS). The switch between the registration servers can be done either via YaST module or via command-line tools.

Before performing the switch between customer cetners, make sure that the target customer cetner serves all products that are registered against SMT. Both YaST the command-line tools perform check to find out whether all products can be served with the new registration server. It it is not possible, the only option is to install parallel SMT and to synchronize products from both SCC and NCC.

To perform the migration to SCC via command-line, run:

  smt ncc-scc-migration

tool. To get its parameter, use the --help option. If you need to revert back from SCC to NCC, use

  smt scc-ncc-migration

The migration itself is time-sonsuming and during the migration process the SMT server may not be able to serve clients, which are already registered.

The migration process itself changes the registration server and the proper type of API in the configuraiton files. There is no other task needed from user to perform the switch.

To migrate between NCC and SCC via YaST, use the YaST smt-server module

After migration, it is needed to re-synchronize the repositories.



Repository structure
====================

The repository structure in the /srv/www/htdocs directory matches the structure as it comes from SCC. This directory structure differs from the structure coming from NCC. There are following directories in the structure (selected examples, similar for other products and architectures):

repo/SUSE:/Products:/SLE-12/images/repo/SLE-12-SDK-POOL-x86_64-Media/

- the -POOL repository of SDK (the GA version of all packages)

repo/SUSE:/Products:/SLE-12/images/repo/SLE-12-SDK-POOL-x86_64-Media.license/

- EULA associated with the product

repo/SUSE:/Updates:/SLE-SDK:/12:/x86_64/standard/
repo/SUSE:/Updates:/SLE-SDK:/12:/s390x/standard/
repo/SUSE:/Updates:/SLE-SERVER:/12:/x86_64/standard/

- Update repositories for respective products

repo/full/SUSE:/Updates:/SLE-SERVER:/12:/x86_64/standard/
repo/testing/SUSE:/Updates:/SLE-SERVER:/12:/x86_64/standard/

- Repositories optionally created for staging of respecive repositories. The semantics is the same as with repositories from NCC


Enabling SLP announcements
==========================

SMT already includes the SLP service description file (/etc/slp.reg.d/smt.reg). In order to enable SLP announcements of the SMT service, open respective ports in firewall and enable the SLP service.

  sysconf_addword /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2 FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP "427"
  sysconf_addword /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2 FW_SERVICES_EXT_UDP "427"
  insserv slpd
  rcslpd start
