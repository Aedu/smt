Hi Eric,

some Questions about the Breakout API:

> Managed devices will not be handled within NCC the same way that regular
> systems. Instead, they will show up as managed devices under the
> ZLM satellite (which is a regular system in NCC).
> Managed devices will not be tied to a subscription, nor will they have an
> install user. Their update level will most likely read "locally managed."

Q 1: Is a customer able to put entitlements to managed devices?
     We need a way that a customer can easily get an overview of
     his systems, his entitlements and if he has enough entitlements
     for his systems.

     E.g. Customer has 10 SLES and 50 SLED systems but only 9 SLES
     and 35 SLED entitlements. Is the customer able to see that he
     has to buy some additional licenses?
   =20
     Will NCC inform the customer that he has to buy additional entitlement=
s?
     E.g. via email.

Q 2: Is it possible to see/show the installed products on the managed
     devices?
     The "info" structure does not look like that it is able to carry
     different products.
