Proposal:

How to use a special user (e.g. smt) to execute the commands,
instead of "root".

* create a system user "smt" in RPM pre section and give him
  permissions to read/write directories and files where neccesary.

* this user get the home /var/lib/empty and as bash /bin/false.

* customer still login as root to call the smt commands.

* the smt commands switch to the smt user, if the calling uid is 0 (root)
  In case a normal user is calling the smt commands, no switch happens.

* we should provide a script which is doing all the chown/chmod things for
  customers who want to use there special user for alling smt commands.
  (e.g. there user is in global ldap directory to prevent switching uidnumbers,
   when mirroring to a NFS mounted directory)


===============================================================================

Files and Directories which need different owners:

* 0644 smt,www /var/log/smt
* 0644 smt,www /var/run/smt
* 0600 smt,root /etc/zypp/credentials.d/NCCcredentials
* what about /root/.curlrc ? Because of the proxy user password?
* smt.conf [LOCAL] MirrorTo: 0644 smt,root (recursive)
  (or better group www? If we download a new file it is created with
   group www)
