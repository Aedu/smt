for informations about the structure in db/schemas/ and how to use it.


Short introduction for a new schema version

 as example we use old schema 0.03 and new schema 0.04
 $driver is mysql or _common if the statements are compatible or not.

- add a directoy db/schemas/$driver/0.04
- put all scripts needed to do an initial setup of this version into
  this directory. The name defined the execution order. 
  Tip: use names like this:

  100_create_new_table.sql
  110_insert_data.sql

- for migration create a directory <startVersion>-<endVersion>

  0.03-0.04 for upgrade and put scripts into this directory
  to upgrade from version 0.03 to 0.04 
  (e.g. alter table statements, etc.)

  0.04-0.03 for downgrade
