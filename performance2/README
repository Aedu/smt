scp -r performance2 root@my.test.host:

If you want to start only on client which performs
registrations again and again, then call:

my.test.host:performance2> ./repeatedStart.pl 0 100

This performes 100 registrations with GUIDs from 0 - 99


If you want to start registrations in parallel on one client
call:

my.test.host:performance2> ./launch.sh 2 100

This starts 2 clients. Every client performes 100 registrations.
The first starting with GUID 0 the second with GUID 100.
